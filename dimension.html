<u><font color= "#800080">Scene:</u> Phil's apartment, They have all just finished eating</font color="#FF0000"></i></u><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> That was a delicious dinner Phil. You are a really good cook<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes he is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Thank you, appreciated<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">I wish I could cook<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">Me too, I don't cook – I burn<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri:</font color="#0000FF"> I 'm not bad, not as good as Phil though<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> You are all to kind. More wine Anyone?<p>

<font color="#0000FF">All: </font color="#0000FF">Yes please etc<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, now we have finished eating, I have something to tell you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF"> I know – We have to wash the dishes (laughter)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">No not that. The dishes can go in the dishwasher – more important than that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">Ohh I am intrigued<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">Me too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">When I tell you this, you are going to think I am crazy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">No problem, we already think you are crazy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky:</font color="#0000FF"> Crazy but a good cook<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Shush this is serious<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">Not too serious I hope<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Well, no. But kind of serious<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">You are really building this up, so come on tell us what this is all about<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, I do believe you have our undivided attention now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Ok. You know that I have always had this passion for old books?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, ever since we were at uni<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">The older and dustier the more you liked them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">You had stacks of them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> I still have<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">So what has this got to do with what you want to tell us?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I was in a really old bookshop on Tuesday. I mean really old. The man that ran it must have been about 120<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">Probably a bit of exaggeration<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Yeh, Ok. But really old<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> It's alright, we get it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Anyway, it was an amazing shop. Little nooks and crannies everywhere. I have never seen so many really old books in one place<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">Where is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I found it down a tiny little side street in Bristol<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">Some lovely little shops in Bristol<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes I love it there<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri:</font color="#0000FF"> So did you buy anything?<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, that is what I wanted to tell you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">Phil, you buying a dusty old book from a dusty old bookshop is hardly front page news<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">This is different<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok I get it – you bought two books<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Just give me a moment and I will explain<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, explain away<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> I flicked through the book and to be honest it wasn't all that interesting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">What was it about?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">It was about the construction of the pyramids<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">Doesn't sound like a great read<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">It wasn't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">Why did you buy it then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> I am getting to that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky:</font color="#0000FF"> But very slowly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I bought it because inside there was a slip of paper<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">I can see how that would clinch the deal<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> No, you don't understand. It was a very interesting piece of paper. Really interesting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">In what way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Let me ask you all something first<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">You know it has been said at times that the Pyramids may have been built by aliens?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">I have heard that but I don't believe it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">Nor do I.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, like they would arrive, build a few Pyramids then fly off, seems very unlikely<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">For what it's worth, I don't believe they were built by aliens either, but I believe there may have been some kind of alien influence<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">In what way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Well, you know there are cave drawings of what look like space ships<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">I always thought that didn't make much sense<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Why?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri:</font color="#0000FF"> Considering that if they were aliens they would have had to come from thousands of light years away and the spaceships carved on the cave walls looked like the space  equivalent of a Fiat Uno<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Good point, and I agree with you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">But you just said you thought there was alien influence<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF">I did, and I do think that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky:</font color="#0000FF"> So, where do you think they came from then? Mars?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF">That is very, very unlikely<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Almost impossible I would think<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">You got me confused now Phil. What exactly do you mean?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Supposing those carvings were not spaceships but some other kind of transport<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">You mean a Fiat Uno (Laughter)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">No not a Fiat Uno but something, maybe similar. A craft for moving around the Earth rather than to it. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">But then they would have to get through space to get those vehicles to Earth<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Not necessarily<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">What do you mean<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Not if they were on Earth already<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> How much wine have you drunk Phil? Because you are not making any sense at all now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">This is not as crazy as it might sound. Physicists work under the assumption that there are at least 10 dimensions, but the majority of us will never "see" them. Because we only know life in 3D, our brains don't understand how to look for anything more  <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> My brain has trouble just coping with this dimension.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">Anyway Phil, what has this to do with the slip of paper you found?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF">I don't know who wrote it of course but it explains how to enter a different dimension<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> I am not sure I understand any of this<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> It appears not to make much sense I agree<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF"> Can you explain it better then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I'll try<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">It's interesting but seems a but to weird to be true<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> I agree, it seems weird but it is believed that there, here on the Earth we know that there are, let's say, other worlds living alongside us<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">I still don't get it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, imagine a wafer biscuit<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri:</font color="#0000FF"> Right, I know what that is. Are you saying we live in a biscuit?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">In a way yes! The biscuit is made up of several layers. Imagine the Earth is a bit like that. Several layers but in the normal course of life we only see and understand the layer we live on. The other layers will still be Earth but different people and different ways of life<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> I think I'll get my coat (laugh)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">Just a minute. Phil may have something. I have actually read before about this. I believe even Einstein believed there was more than just the three dimensions we know<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Exactly. He did but that is something a little different to what I am talking about<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">I am beginning to understand it now. You say you now have information on how to – well – kind of enter a different dimension to the one we know?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Yes! Exactly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> No, this is too unlikely. Are you saying Phil that you are the only person on Earth that has this information?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Who knows? There may be others but they just never talk about it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri:</font color="#0000FF"> That seems unlikely<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I agree, it does<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> So have you tried it Phil?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">(a short pause) No, not yet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> To be honest I didn't want to try it on my own<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> I am not sure really, just felt a bit apprehensive about it and I did think that even if I did try it maybe people wouldn't believe that I had ever done it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> So this is the reason you invited us to dinner this evening?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Basically, yes. I wanted to ask you all if you would come with me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri:</font color="#0000FF"> I don't mind doing it because in all honesty I think the slip of paper may be a hoax and absolutely nothing would happen<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Unless we try it we would never know<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> Something we should bear in mind, If it isn't a hoax and we actually do pass into another dimension couldn't it be dangerous?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">What do you mean?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> You said that it would be like another world, with different people. If that is the case how do we know they would not be hostile?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">That is a good point and probably why I have hesitated to try it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">I don't do dangerous, so this may not be for me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">There is also something else that concerns me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF"> What's that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> I think sometimes people may slip through by accident<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> What makes you think that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Sometimes people just disappear, right? Nobody ever sees them again and nobody knows where they went<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes I have read about quite a few cases like that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> And maybe you will laugh at this but what about the Bermuda Triangle?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">You are thinking that the planes and ships that disappeared there slipped into a different dimension?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I'm saying it's possible<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">That is worrying then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Why?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">Because all those planes and ships and the people inside them  - never came back!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, Very good point<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I did think about that, but there would be a difference<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF"> How?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Well, they disappeared by accident so would have had no idea how it happened or how to get back. We have instructions so it is very different<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">No certainty though that you'd get back<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I guess not but I would feel very confident about it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">So are you going to try it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, if I can get someone to come with me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">There is something else I am thinking<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">You described this as being like the layers of a wafer biscuit?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Kind of, yes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> So if this is all possible and you slip through into another dimension, how do you know that you will come back to this one and not one of the other layers?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, that is a very good point Candy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> I thought about that too, and think I have a plan to make sure we get back to this dimension.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF"> You say we?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Well  -  yes. I was hoping you would all come with me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">I would. It sounds kind of exciting if it works<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">Hmm I'd think about it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">I am pretty sure it isn't going to work anyway so I'd do it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">I am not sure about this. If it does work it could be dangerous, we might not get back and perhaps it is something we should not mess with. Like you said, none of those people that disappeared ever came back<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh come on Micky, don't be such a scaredy cat – you only live once<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">And if we do this, it may not be for much longer<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">Yes come on Micky, it could be fun<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Terri: </font color="#0000FF">When would we do it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> What about now? No time like the present<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">Should we take something with us? Like torches or a weapon or something<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I don't have any weapons, or a torch<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky:</font color="#0000FF"> That is so typical. I left my kalishnikov at home this evening<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">That's better Micky, at least you can joke about it now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">So what exactly do we have to do Phil? Is there a secret place we have to go to or something like that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">No we can do it right here, with a bit of preparation<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toni: </font color="#0000FF">What sort of preparation<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> First I need a good plain wall<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> We could move the sofa a little and use that one<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Good idea<p>
(There is the sound of a little puffing and grunting as the sofa is moved)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">How's that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Perfect. Now I need to copy some calculus from the note I found on to the wall<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">Won't that spoil the wall?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">I can paint it again later<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">Here, use this felt pen then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, Can someone hold the note for me while I write<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toni: </font color="#0000FF">Here, I'll do it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Thanks Toni, Now here goes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> Wow! That looks complicated<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">I don't get this. The people in the Bermuda Triangle and the others that disappeared, I am assuming they didn't do this?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Quite right. But imagine the wafer biscuit has tiny holes in it. Some people and things have slipped through by accident but there is an actual gateway – which we are preparing now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">I am still not convinced it will work<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">You may be right but I can't wait to try<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">That is an awful lot of calculi you are writing up there Phil<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">And I am being very careful. It has to be perfect<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toni: </font color="#0000FF">Even if it doesn't work it looks very impressive<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> Looks like you are a science teacher<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Ok done, before we try we need to make a couple of precautions though. We need something sturdy to tie a piece of rope to<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey:</font color="#0000FF"> How about the radiator?<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Yes that will do, I bought the rope yesterday<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF"> Why do we need rope?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Candy raised a valid concern that we may not get back to the right layer, If we keep hold of the rope that could guide us back<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">Are you sure about that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">No but it does kind of make sense. Are we all ready then? Lets all stand side by side and hold hands, we have to keep together. I'll grip the rope with my other hand<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toni: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, now what?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">This sounds crazy I know, but just walk towards the wall, we should pass right through it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">You are joking right?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">No, Just walk slowly and hopefully it will work<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">This really does seem crazy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana:</font color="#0000FF"> I agree but we have come this far so lets try<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, let's walk<p>
( A short pause)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">OH MY GOODNESS!!!!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">It worked. Where's your room Phil?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">It's kind of dark<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> It is just light enough to see though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toni: </font color="#0000FF">What's that over there?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Lets move closer but I don't want to let go of the rope<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> How weird! I see what it is now?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> What?<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Candy:</font color="#0000FF"> It's a huge  - well, mountain of socks!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">Pairs of socks?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">No, not pairs, they are all just single ones<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> Over this way, quickly. Look at this<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toni:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes! Ball point pens! Millions of them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">And over here, look. Have you ever seen so many bunches of keys<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">There are piles and piles of junk. All kinds of junk<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">No, this isn't really junk<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">What is it then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Isn't it obvious? We have come to a dimension where things that are lost from ours have ended up<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes of course<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toni: </font color="#0000FF">Yes I have lost dozens of pens<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> And I have a drawer full of single socks, the other half of the pair must be here<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">This is just creepy. Let's go back<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil:</font color="#0000FF"> Good idea. All hold hands again and I will guide you in with the rope<p>

( a short pause)<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">Phewww. It's good to be back in your apartment Phil<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alana: </font color="#0000FF">Yeh definitely, that was too weird for me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jenny:</font color="#0000FF"> I can barely believe it happened<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toni:</font color="#0000FF"> I am never going to tell a soul, they wouldn't believe me anyway<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Lets all have another glass of wine<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Candy: </font color="#0000FF">Great idea Phil<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phil: </font color="#0000FF">Hmmmm. Has anybody seen the corkscrew? I am sure I left it here on the table<p>
